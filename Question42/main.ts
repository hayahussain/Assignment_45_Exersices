                       // QUESTION 42

// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() 
// that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name.
// Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

function show_magicians(magician: string[]){
    magician.forEach(name => console.log(name)
);
}
function make_great(magician: string[]){
    return magician.map(name => `The great ${name}`)
}

let magicians_names: string[] = ["Azlan", "Zohan", "Saif"]

let Great_magician = make_great( magicians_names)

show_magicians(Great_magician);
